Clean and relax. Wonderful health wellness benefits. Such as on-site exercise/wellness classes every day (twice a day on most days). That type of benefit is a HUGE plus and $$ saver if you truly care about taking care of your body, while bending over backwards for a \"start-up\". You get a \"birthday\" PTO. Unlimited vacations, (they encourage you to take), stocked kitchen (snacks, drinks, beer). Competitive health plans. Extra allowance for \"health\" - which I use it on massage therapy and is free to use it on whatever your choosing. Management truly tries to get the stakeholders to sign off on the annual bonus plan. Many free t-shirts, and are encouraged to wear it as your work attire. (I don\\'t remember the last time I wore slacks). No more free catered meals, but still some free delivery due to lunch time meetings. Friday company-wide happy hour is fun to see everyone/meet new people. Everyone are very nice, many sincere where they can truly be your \"Fitbit family\". The founder and Co-founder are kind and nice people. They may look intense when walking around the office (to many things on their mind) but no egotistical behavior at all.

Strong talent pool. Sales have picked up in a meaningful way. We should be profitable again this year (at least by internal projections). Releasing a new form factor watch this year. The company\\'s is headed in the right direction. Stock hasn\\'t done too well, but most employees are pretty optimistic still. Management has become very proactive in acquiring new partners. Some complaints here and there from employees about cuts in \"perks\", but honestly, I most of SF employees are spoiled. A public company should be operating lean and mean. At the end of the day, I\\'d much rather sacrifice free daily lunches for helping to create a strong company of the future. Lots of opportunity in this space. We are actively trying to push into the global market where wearables have performed much stronger. US seems to be too saturated. Global markets have performed well and seem to be getting stronger. Willing to train and invest in employees\\r\\nCompany perks (no longer providing to employees)\\r\\nCareer growth (no longer promoting or training employe no no pros at all Smart, friendly employees \\r\\nFree food\\r\\nClose to transportation\\r\\nEngaging work (if your mission is to improve others\\' health) Great people, mission driven and fun place to work good perks and healthy work space Free food Smart people Good location Great work-life balance, awesome people, good work atmosphere - Smart, entrepreneurial exec team\\r\\n- Fun, active, young culture\\r\\n- Be part of a movement - in many way! Fun people, happy hours and career development opportunity. Compensation, Location, if you are on an interesting team you will have fun. No micromanaging. Flex time. Good pay. Nice location. Co-workers are fantastic and supportive. The environment is relaxed and not at all corporate. The employees that make up the Research and Development team are kind, intelligent, and hard working individuals who any company would be more than lucky to have. The work that they do goes unrecognized and is often exploited by upper management in order to \"show off\" to stake holders and other company employees - all the while not giving credit or coinciding support to those putting in the work. * Products aim to help millions of people achieve fitness goals and live healthier lives. \\r\\n* Flexible work schedule and healthy work/life balance. Well rounded benefits. \\r\\n* Ability to work on beta-testing of new hardware by all employees. staffers are thoughtful, innovative, and genuinely want to improve the health of their users nice people, good product, free trackers Well known brand, low expectations, relaxed environment. Great place to hang out if you don\\'t want to work hard. The mission of creating products to enable peoples\\' fitness and health is wonderful and motivating\\r\\nGenerally very nice and highly competent non-managerial colleagues\\r\\nVery nice office space\\r\\nFairly descent compensation Lots of Learning. New Technology. Decent Snacks. Fitbit has hired some good people who try to do the right thing. #NAME? product team is great to work with.  Very smart people. Its a job with no benefit and no direction from middle management and sr. engineers - Offices in downtown SF. No south bay commute is nice.\\r\\n- Cool to work on hardware products.\\r\\n- Raw passion and compassion for colleagues at the lowest levels of the hierarchy. Fitbit wants to be a great company.  The founders are well intended.  There have been some serious management shake-ups in the upper echelons of the company in an attempt to right the ship. The Research team remains very friendly, comprised of smart people, and has great work-life balance (basically borderline irresponsibly lax work culture).\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently the Research leadership has attempted to crack down on useless projects and finally acknowledged the widespread dissatisfaction with career develop as an actual problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiring is now happening again, mostly because lots of talent either got fired or left. Snacks, Great work/life balance, \"unlimited\" ptos, downtown SF Lots of super talented engineers, great company culture. Okay benefit in general. Best colleagues you will ever have; Zero Politics; smart colleagues; flat organizational structure; very humble management; everyone is treated with respect; good product; cooperative and respectful work culture; good work life balance; people are always willing to help; a profound sense of we are in it together. Fun, fast place to work! Fun product, loved workout Wednesdays. Fitbit allowed me the opportunity to work with a company from the ground up. I was able to learn a lot about start-up culture and how to manage my time in an ever-changing environment. I was able to grow in my career and find a path that is fulfilling. Attracts many fitness enthusiasts. Everyone knows Fitbit and it\\'s exciting to work for a company whose products you can see in public every day. Coworkers are generally good people. Lots of team building activities. Product are ok.  Free snacks and meals. Great sense of purpose helping people work towards fitness goals. Like many companies, they demand the best from you. But not in an exhausting, run-you-to-the-ground way. They were very supportive in my role and when I had questions. Gave me the freedom to explore different options to do my tasks as long as they were given the information they needed. They had a good sense of work-life balance and this was refreshing, especially coming from the video game industry; which has no idea of work-life balance for their employees. Great people to work with \\r\\nStaffs are always friendly and more than willing to help one another Dedicated and capable design group. Creative engineers. Good, open environment for collaboration and teamwork. Interesting technology and cool products.  Smart co-workers 1. Some genuinely great, intellectual and driven people eager to push the company forward.\\r\\n2. Flexible Work Schedule\\r\\n3. Lots of opportunity to learn Im left alone to do my work, my manager is not shy to tell me what he thinks about my progress for better or worse. After a pretty bad 2016, Fitbit\\'s CEO laid it to us straight: 2017 is going to be a rebuilding year. We are only at the beginning of our reorg, but it\\'s clear that this is no joke: About 100 people were laid off, and some very high level people were \"mutually decided\" off. Company structure makes a lot of sense, with more revenue streams being pursued. \\n\\n+ Can make tough decisions\\n+ We are still building amazing things that make people healthier\\n+ Great work/life balance\\n+ Amazing brand Fast-paced, growing company (how? their stock is terrible and they\\'re losing tons of money.) - Great people to work with\\r\\n- The brand and products are widely recognized by people in a positive way\\r\\n- Work life balance can be okay depending on your group and manager Great product to work for Leading great Mission and Vision Flexible working schedule. Work from home is an option if you\\'re a golden child. Great aspirations, good intentions, some awesome folks who are a pleasure to work with. Great work culture, love the people, love the product Exciting colleagues, fun company activities, located in SF downtown, great work-life balance, makers of a great health product. Free trackers and ok compensation. Great products, great people, great perks! Love the flexible time off policy (unlimited vacation), on-site fitness classes, no meeting Wednesdays, WOW -(Work out Weds- wear workout gear to the office). Gorgeous office space in great downtown location (easy BART commute), great snacks, love beta testing new products. CEO/ founder is approachable and humble- great guy!'"
